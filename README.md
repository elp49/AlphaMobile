

To execute the program, either open a windows command prompt and locate the
directory with the following files, or open the containing folder in a file
explorer.

-	Classes.cs
-	run-client.bat

If you are using the command prompt, you may run the batch file by typing
'run-client' into the command line and hit enter. If you are using the file
explorer, you may run the batch file by double clicking it.

The batch file will create an executable file called Classes.exe, run the
executable, and then delete the executable file.
